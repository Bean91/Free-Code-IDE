# Free Code IDE

**Free Code IDE** is a fast, modern, cross-platform integrated development environment built from scratch with a custom rendering engine and a minimalist user interface. Designed for developers who want full control and zero bloat, Free Code IDE aims to be an alternative to existing tools like VS Code and JetBrains Fleet — but fully open source and truly lightweight.
